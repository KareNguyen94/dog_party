# dog_party
I made a site about dogs just from looking at a photo and made it do random things with using:
-Html 
-CSS
-JavaScript

## The layout with HTML
Learing how to seperate HTML code sections to make it look "prettier" and using sematic markups correctly.

## Making the Layout look pretty through CSS
Classifying "Id" and "class" in HTML to pull from and creating a layout from a photo given. 
Splitting sections up and starting it from the top to bottom from HTML and CSS.
As well as learning how borders, padding and margins work.

## Lets make it do something!
using JavaScript to make my buttons do things which includes: changing the name in my h1, hiding my paragraphs, 
and changing text of my paragraphs by using functions and variables properly.
